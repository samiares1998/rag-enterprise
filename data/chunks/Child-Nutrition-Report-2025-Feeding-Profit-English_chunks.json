Unhealthy \ndiets increase the risk of overweight, obesity and \nother cardiometabolic conditions in children and \nadolescents, including high blood pressure, elevated \nblood glucose and abnormal blood lipid levels. These \nhealth problems can persist into adult life, increasing \nthe risk of non-communicable diseases, including \ntype 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some \ncancers. Overweight and obesity are also associated \nwith low self-esteem, anxiety and depression among \nchildren and adolescents.

Economies throughout \nthe world are already struggling with escalating \nhealth care costs and reduced workforce productivity \nbecause of rising overweight and obesity.\nThe ultra-processed food and beverage industry \nholds disproportionate influence over children’s food \nenvironments. It shapes what foods and beverages \nare produced and how they are marketed, especially \nin settings where government regulation is weak or \nabsent. In pursuit of profit, the industry leverages \nvast financial resources and deep political influence \nto resist policies aimed at creating healthier, more \nequitable food environments. This imbalance of \npower makes it difficult for governments, communities \nand families to protect children’s right to food \nand nutrition. \nOUR RESEARCH\nThe forces shaping children’s diets\nThis global report examines how unhealthy food \nenvironments are shaping children’s and adolescents’ \ndiets and contributing to the surge in overweight",

  "beverages – including ultra-processed foods and \nbeverages – are embedded in children’s diets in early \nlife and persist into late adolescence.\nFinding 1. The global surge in overweight is \naffecting children and adolescents in every \nregion of the world.\nGlobally, one in twenty children under 5 years of age \n(5 per cent) and one in five children and adolescents \naged 5–19 years (20 per cent) are living with \noverweight. Latin America and the Caribbean, the \nMiddle East and North Africa and North America rank \nin the top three regions for overweight prevalence \namong children and adolescents aged 0–19 years. \nHowever, East Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and \nthe Caribbean and South Asia account for more than \nhalf of all children and adolescents with overweight \nglobally (241 million out of 427 million).\nSince 2000, the number of children and adolescents \naged 5–19 years living with overweight has doubled \nfrom 194 million to 391 million. Some regions have",
  "from 194 million to 391 million. Some regions have \nexperienced a much greater rise in overweight than \nothers. In South Asia, the region with the lowest \nprevalence of overweight in 2000, the prevalence \nincreased almost fivefold by 2022, and in East Asia \nand the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, \nand the Middle East and North Africa, the prevalence \nincreased by at least 10 percentage points.\nFinding 2. Low- and middle-income countries are \nexperiencing the steepest rise in overweight in \nschool-age children and adolescents.\nThe prevalence of overweight among children and \nadolescents aged 5–19 years has historically been \nhighest in high-income countries. However, since \n2000, overweight has more than doubled in low- and \nmiddle-income countries, compared to a modest \n1.2-fold increase in high-income countries. As a result, \nthe gap in prevalence is narrowing, and low- and \nmiddle-income countries now account for 81 per cent",
  "middle-income countries now account for 81 per cent \nof the global overweight burden, up from 66 per cent \nin 2000.\nAs nations develop economically, the pattern of child \noverweight shifts. In low-income countries, children \nare more likely to have overweight if they belong \nto wealthier households, which can afford larger \nquantities of food, including energy-dense foods. \nAs countries transition to middle-income status, \nultra-processed foods and beverages become more \nwidely available and more affordable, increasing the \nprevalence of overweight among children across all \nhousehold income levels. In high-income countries, \nthe pattern reverses: nutrient-poor, unhealthy diets \nare a marker of poverty, not affluence, and child \noverweight tends to be more common among children \nand adolescents belonging to poorer households.\nFinding 3. Globally, obesity has overtaken \nunderweight as the more dominant form of \nmalnutrition among school-age children and \nadolescents.",
  "underweight as the more dominant form of \nmalnutrition among school-age children and \nadolescents.\nSince 2000, obesity has risen at a faster rate \nthan overweight among school-age children and \nadolescents. At the same time, there has been a \nsteady fall in the prevalence of underweight. In 2025, \na historic turning point was reached: for the first \ntime, the global prevalence of obesity among children \nand adolescents aged 5–19 years surpassed that of \nunderweight (9.4 per cent versus 9.2 per cent).\nObesity accounts for a growing share of all overweight \ncases. In 2022, 42 per cent of all children and \nadolescents aged 5–19 years living with overweight \nhad obesity (163 million out of 391 million), up from \n30 per cent in 2000 (58 million out of 194 million). This \nis immensely concerning because obesity is more \ndifficult to reverse than overweight and has a greater \nrisk of serious health conditions.\nFinding 4.

The diets of children and adolescents \nare loaded with unhealthy foods and beverages, \nincluding ultra-processed foods. \nIn 2021, UNICEF and WHO introduced new indicators \nfor monitoring the consumption of unhealthy foods \nand beverages in children aged 6–23 months, such \nas sweet, salty and fried foods and sweet beverages. \nWhile there are currently insufficient data to produce \nglobal estimates, available data show that more than \n50 per cent of young children consumed sweet foods \nor beverages during the previous day in 13 out of 20 \nlow- and middle-income countries. \nHOW FOOD ENVIRONMENTS ARE FAILING CHILDREN  3\nIn adolescents aged 15–19 years, data from the \nGlobal Diet Quality Project reveal that a staggering \n60 per cent consumed more than one sugary food \nor beverage during the previous day, 32 per cent \nconsumed a soft drink and 25 per cent consumed \nmore than one salty processed food. Furthermore,",

These levels are so high that they \nmatch the description of a staple food – meaning they \nconstitute a dominant portion of adolescents’ diets.\nOUR ANALYSIS\nThe drivers of unhealthy food \nenvironments\t\nOur analysis finds that unhealthy foods and \nbeverages, including ultra-processed foods and \nbeverages, are widely available, inexpensive and \naggressively marketed in the places where children \nlive, learn and play.

Inexpensive ultra-processed foods \nand beverages are flooding retail markets and \ninfiltrating schools.\nGlobal sales of ultra-processed foods and beverages \nare rising sharply, driven by rapid growth in middle-\nincome countries, where modern retail outlets, online \ngrocery stores and food delivery apps are expanding \nrapidly, alongside traditional outlets. These ultra-\nprocessed foods and beverages tend to be relatively \ncheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious \nfoods – due partly to agricultural subsidies that \nartificially lower the cost of key ingredients, such as \ncorn, soy and wheat. \nEvidence from both high- and middle-income \ncountries shows that retailers disproportionately \nexpose children in poorer neighbourhoods to",
  "countries shows that retailers disproportionately \nexpose children in poorer neighbourhoods to \nunhealthy foods and beverages, including ultra-\nprocessed foods and beverages. For example, our \nresearch in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and \nMexico found that retailers were more likely to \nprominently display sweet snacks and sugary cereals \nat entrances and within children’s reach in poorer \ncommunities than in wealthier areas.\nIn the absence of effective policies, schools are also \nbeing infiltrated by unhealthy foods and beverages – \nundermining their role as safe spaces for children and \nadolescents. According to the Global Survey of School \nMeal Programs, one in four school meal programmes \nserve processed meat (25 per cent), about one in five \nserve sweets/ice-cream (21 per cent) and deep-fried \nfoods (19 per cent), and 14 per cent provide sugar-\nsweetened beverages.

These foods are often \ncheap, accessible and aggressively marketed – \nespecially to children and adolescents. The surge \nin childhood overweight and obesity reflects this \nreality and signals a failure to uphold children’s \nright to food and nutrition. \nAt the root of the problem lies a lack of effective policy \nand the unchecked influence of an industry that profits \nfrom unhealthy foods and beverages. Countries must \nact now to prevent a future in which unhealthy food",
  "act now to prevent a future in which unhealthy food \nenvironments deepen nutrition and health inequities \namong children and adolescents. Countries such as \nBrazil, Chile and Mexico demonstrate that with strong \npolitical will, governments can create policy conditions \nfor healthier food environments for children. \nEight key recommendations\nImmediate and transformative actions are needed \nto improve food environments and protect children’s \nright to food and nutrition. The following eight \nrecommendations are universally applicable, including \nin humanitarian contexts: \n1.\t Implement the International Code of \nMarketing of Breast-milk Substitutes \nand subsequent World Health Assembly \nresolutions to protect and promote \nbreastfeeding and appropriate \ncomplementary feeding. This includes the \nWHO guidance on regulatory measures aimed \nat restricting the digital marketing of breastmilk \nsubstitutes, and the guidance on ending the \ninappropriate promotion of foods for infants and",

These encompass \nlegal measures and policies that protect children’s \ndiets by limiting the availability, marketing and \npurchase of unhealthy foods and beverages, \nincluding ultra-processed foods. They include \nschool food environments, food marketing \nrestrictions, food labelling, taxes on unhealthy \nfoods and beverages, and food reformulation that \nlimits both unhealthy ingredients and harmful \nsubstitutes.  \n3.\t Implement comprehensive policies to \nimprove the availability and affordability of \nlocally produced nutritious foods for children \nand adolescents.

This includes \nconflict-of-interest safeguards, the exclusion of \nultra-processed food and beverage industry actors \nfrom involvement in policy development and \nimplementation, and the mandatory reporting of \nindustry lobbying activities and membership in \ntrade and business associations.\n5.\t Implement social and behaviour change \ninitiatives that empower families and \ncommunities to claim their right to healthy \nfood environments, raise awareness of the \nharm caused by diets high in ultra-processed",
  "food environments, raise awareness of the \nharm caused by diets high in ultra-processed \nfoods and beverages and build public support \nfor legal measures and policies to transform food \nenvironments for children.\n6.\t Strengthen social protection programmes \nto address income poverty and increase \nchildren’s access to nutritious and healthy \ndiets through social transfers (food, cash, \nvouchers) and other forms of social protection (e.g., \nparental benefits, affordable childcare and labour \nmarket programmes).\n7.\t Engage young people in public policymaking \non food justice by fostering youth-led \nadvocacy. Support young advocates to share their \nlived experiences of unhealthy food environments \nand amplify their voices to demand healthier food \nand beverage options in schools, communities and \nbeyond.\n8.\t Strengthen global and national data and \nsurveillance systems to monitor food \nenvironments, diets and overweight among \nchildren and adolescents using standardized",
