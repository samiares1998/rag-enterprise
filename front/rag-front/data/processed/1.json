The room should be warm; if possible there should be an open fire. The head and face should first be washed and dried; then the body should be soaped and the infant placed in the tub with\nits body well supported by the hand of the nurse. The bath should be given quickly, and the body dried rapidly with a soft towel, but with very little rubbing.\n\nAt what temperature should the bath be given?\n\nFor the first few weeks at 100° F.; later, during early infancy, at 98° F.; after six months, at 95° F.; during the second year, from 85° to 90° F.\n\nWith what should the bath be given?\n\nSoft sponges are useful for bathing the body, limbs and scalp. There should be a separate wash-cloth for the face and another for the buttocks.\nWhat are the objections to bath sponges?\nWhen used frequently, they become very dirty and are liable to cause infection of the eyes, mouth or genital organs.\n\nUnder what circumstances should the daily tub bath be omitted?\n\nIn the case of very feeble or delicate infants on account of the exposure and fatigue, and in all forms of acute illness except by direction of the physician. In eczema and many other forms of skin disease much harm is often done by bathing with\nsoap and water, or even with water alone.\n"
