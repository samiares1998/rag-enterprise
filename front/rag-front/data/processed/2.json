  "text": "GENITAL ORGANS\nHow should the genital organs of a female child be cleansed?\n\nBest with fresh absorbent cotton and tepid water, or a solution of boric acid, two teaspoonfuls to the pint. This should be done carefully at least once a day. If any discharge is present, the boric-acid solution should invariably be used twice a day.\nGreat care is necessary at all times to prevent infection which often arises from soiled napkins.\n\nHow should the genital organs of a male child be cleansed?\n\nIn infancy and early childhood the foreskin should be pushed back at least twice a week while the child is in his bath, and the parts thus exposed washed gently with absorbent cotton and water.\nIf the foreskin is tightly adherent and cannot readily be pushed back, the physician's attention should be called to it. The nurse or mother should not attempt forcible stretching.\n\nWhen is circumcision advisable?\n\nUsually, when the foreskin is very long and so tight that it cannot be pushed back without force; always, when this condition is accompanied by evidences of local irritation or difficulty in passing water.\n\nEYES\nHow should the eyes of a little baby be cleansed?\nWith a piece of soft linen or absorbent cotton and a lukewarm solution of salt or boric acid,â€”one half of an even teaspoonful to one pint of water.\nIf pus appears in the eyes, what should be done?\n\nThey should be cleansed every hour with a solution of boric acid (ten grains to one ounce of water). If the lids stick together, a little vaseline from a tube should be rubbed upon them at night. If the trouble is slight, this treatment will control it; if it\nis severe, a physician should be called immediately, as delay may result in loss of eyesight.\n"
